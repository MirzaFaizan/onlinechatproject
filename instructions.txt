This is a Responsive Modern Front end multipage website with a backend chat application and database managment of its clients
and workers (developers in our case).
clients signup for ordering a project, once they signup they can select the type of project they want and order it.
upon ordering the chat with the required developer starts.
the developer chats and make the required project upon complettion/ cancellation he can input that.
all of this activity is monitored by the admin.
the admin can view every developers chat with the client and progress of each project.

to install this web app:
upload files to the webhosting.

goto phpmyadmin in your hosting. make a new database called project.

after creating database click import and import the project.sql file there.

to establish a connection with database goto
d_project > application > config > database.php 
goto the bottom of file
you should see this code

$db['default'] = array(
	'dsn'	=> '',
	'hostname' => 'localhost',
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => '',
	'database' => 'project',
	'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',

	'encrypt' => FALSE,
	'compress' => FALSE,
